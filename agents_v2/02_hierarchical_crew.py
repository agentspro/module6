Hierarchical CrewAI Example: Manager-led Process

This example demonstrates CrewAI's hierarchical process:
- Automatic manager agent creation
- Task delegation based on agent capabilities
- Validation of outcomes by manager
- Complex project coordination

In hierarchical mode, a manager agent:
1. Plans task execution
2. Delegates to appropriate specialists
3. Reviews and validates outputs
4. Ensures quality standards

Python: 3.10-3.13

"""
KEY CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:

1. HIERARCHICAL PROCESS:
   - Manager agent auto-created by CrewAI
   - Manager plans, delegates, and validates
   - Specialists focus on their expertise
   - Dynamic task allocation

2. MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES:
   - Analyzes task requirements
   - Assigns tasks to best-suited agents
   - Reviews outputs for quality
   - Coordinates dependencies
   - Makes strategic decisions

3. AGENT SPECIALIZATION:
   - Each agent has narrow, focused expertise
   - allow_delegation=False for specialists
   - Manager handles coordination
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. TASK DELEGATION:
   - Tasks assigned to specific agents
   - Manager can override if needed
   - Dependencies handled automatically
   - Validation at each step

HIERARCHICAL VS SEQUENTIAL:

Sequential:
  ✓ Simple, predictable flow
  ✓ All tasks execute in order
  ✗ No dynamic decision-making
  ✗ Limited flexibility

Hierarchical:
  ✓ Intelligent task routing
  ✓ Quality validation
  ✓ Adaptive execution
  ✗ More complex
  ✗ Higher token usage (manager LLM calls)

WHEN TO USE HIERARCHICAL:

1. Complex projects with multiple specialties
2. Need for quality validation
3. Dynamic task dependencies
4. Uncertain execution path
5. Large teams (5+ agents)

MANAGER CONFIGURATION:

- manager_llm: Specifies model for manager (can be different from agents)
- Manager is NOT in agents list (auto-created)
- Manager has elevated decision-making capabilities
- Manager can reassign tasks if needed

BEST PRACTICES:

1. Clear Agent Roles:
   - Each agent should have distinct expertise
   - Avoid overlapping responsibilities
   - Detailed backstories improve delegation

2. Task Descriptions:
   - Be specific about deliverables
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Mention quality standards

3. Manager Model:
   - Use capable model for manager (GPT-4 recommended)
   - Manager makes critical decisions
   - Impacts overall quality

4. Monitoring:
   - Use verbose=True for debugging
   - Watch manager's delegation decisions
   - Review validation steps

LIMITATIONS:

1. Manager agents cannot have tools directly
   - Workaround: Create assistant agent with tools
   - Manager delegates to assistant

2. Higher cost:
   - Additional LLM calls for manager
   - More tokens for coordination

3. Complexity:
   - Harder to debug
   - Less predictable execution path

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

Manager will:
1. Analyze the project requirements
2. Delegate to Requirements Analyst
3. Review requirements, delegate to Architect
4. Review architecture, delegate to developers
5. Review implementations, delegate to QA
6. Validate final deliverables

✅ АВТОМАТИЧНЕ ЗБЕРЕЖЕННЯ РЕЗУЛЬТАТІВ:
- Цей скрипт використовує FileWriterTool для автоматичного збереження
- Створюється агент "Documentation Specialist" з FileWriterTool
- Останній Task збирає всі результати та зберігає у project_deliverables.md
- Результати також виводяться в консоль для перегляду

Реалізація:
  ```python
  from crewai_tools import FileWriterTool

  documentation_specialist = Agent(
      role="Documentation Specialist",
      goal="Compile and save all project deliverables",
      tools=[FileWriterTool()]
  )

  save_task = Task(
      description="Save all deliverables to project_deliverables.md",
      expected_output="Confirmation that file was saved",
      agent=documentation_specialist
  )
  ```

DELEGATION ERRORS:
- Помилки делегування (delegation errors) - це нормально в hierarchical режимі
- Manager може перепризначити завдання іншому агенту якщо перший не справився
- Це частина процесу самокорекції
- Якщо зависло - встановіть max_iterations у Crew(..., max_iterations=10)
